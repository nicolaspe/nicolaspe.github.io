What happens if the physical encounter of two bodies is replaced by a virtual encounter in mid-air between two gazes?
<!--more-->

What if you don’t see somebody’s eyes, but you you know you are looking at the same point in the distance? “meet_” plays with the notion of non-physical, invisible and at the end virtual encounters in a real space.

As part of the “meet_” project, “re_ mote” expands the exploration of the replacing the physical encounter by the crossing of gazes. “re_ mote” connects gazes from different parts of the world, while also showcasing the intersection itself.

Two booths display the stream of a webcam on each entrance of the cylinder, while also capturing the spectators. Their gazes cross in the middle of the cylinder, creating a virtual encounter in a separate location, thousands of miles apart.

At the same time, the cylinder is showcased as a physical installation that allows the audience to be a guest and perceive the crossing itself. Another screen, this one at the installation, briefly shows the spectators that connect in a virtual meeting space.
