#### Concept
Dinoseed is a stop-motion project which wants to cause surprise and wonder, while exploring different effects that this technique enables. In this short, we defy people’s expectations, combining varied elements and a minimalistic sound that sets the mood of the audience.

My role: camera work, production, edition and sound.

Made in collaboration with [Sandy Hsieh](http://www.sandyhsieh.com/) and [Hau Yuan](http://www.yuanhau.com/).

#### Concept
Representation of some passages in the book “Cien años de soledad” (One Hundred Years of Solitude) by Gabriel García Márquez. As time passes and history develops, certain moments are burned in our memories. And when the secret book written by Melquíades is found, reality crumbles away and becomes dust.

Made in After-Effects and edited in DaVinci Resolve.

#### Concept
Wherever you go, social structures of patriarchy will follow. The rules upon which modern society have been built are put in doubt, but its defense is as aggressive as always. As we seek change, people in positions of power fight back, and no magic item is there to make this go faster... or is there?

Made in Unreal Engine; characters designed on Fuse CC and animated in Mixamo; video edition in DaVinci Resolve.
