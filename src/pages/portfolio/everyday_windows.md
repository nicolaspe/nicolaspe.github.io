Sexism, harassment, abuseâ€¦ They all have been historically regarded as personal issues, relegating them from the public discussion, and diverting attention of their status as sociopolitical systemic problems. We want to show what happens behind the doors -or windows, in this case-, what women (mostly cis-het, middle class) go through and how society as a whole contributes to the expansion of these issues.


## Behind the windows
This project was created in *three.js* and rendered with the help of the *WebVR API*, with an accessibility purpose. By making this project browser-based, people are able to use it on their phones with a Google Cardboard without having to install any additional software. It's mounted on a *node.js* server connected via *WebSockets* to an *Arduino MKR1000*, which powers the physical controller.

## Fabrication
The house was built with black cardboard and a wooden frame skeleton. We designed and laser cut the windows and silhouettes that go behind them, placing matte paper between them to generate the shadow projections. Each individual room was illuminated by a *NeoPixel* in a specific color, matching the corresponding VR scene. Finally, we installed buttons with pulsating LED rings, prompting the user to interact with the project.
