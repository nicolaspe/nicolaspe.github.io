## Concept
For this musical project, we wanted to take a step away from the usual tonal, melodic or rhythmic creations. So, in an attempt to cover our musical weaknesses we used computer-generated voices to create a duet which takes user input and randomly decides a new line to sing along.

This web-based project was built with the *[p5.Speech](http://ability.nyu.edu/p5.js-speech/)* library, a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) implementation of *[Google's Speech Synthesis API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk-Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API)*. It features a simple UI, with two animated sine waves that represent each of the performers.

The computer performer was made with a socially-engaged dirty personality. It alternates between phrases about social issues (*"global warming"*), it's own dirty thoughts (*"all night long"*), or sometimes both (*"impeach me, baby"*).
