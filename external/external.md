# External work
I have provided a diverse set of services to a wide variety of clients, ranging from full production and management to technical consultancies.


## *Ana Min Wein? (Where am I from?)* 
*for [Nouf Aljowaysir](http://www.noufaljowaysir.com/)*

**Role: Producer and Creative Support**

Producer and creative production support for Nouf Aljowaysir’s short documentary AI film, [*Ana Min Wein?*](https://channel.somersethouse.org.uk/artworks/all/ana-min-wein-where-am-i-from), as part of the PATH AI commissions from Somerset House. 

For this project, I worked closely alongside the director to manage and plan the timeline and budget for this 5-month residency. This scope was adjusted by taking particular considerations of her specific strengths, expertise areas, and new challenges, as well as the project's overall necessities and estimated hurdles. I was also in charge of the coordination of the project, which included reaching out for and hiring an animator to cover unmet needs, and holding recurring check-in meetings to keep track of the progress and provide timely feedback.

During production, I performed additional creative assistance with tasks such as film editing, sound design, and camerography, in order to ensure the director's desired impact and message. Finally, I have been assisting in coordinating and planning the distribution strategy of the film for international films and showcases, including the physical [World Premiere in London, UK at Somerset House](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/click-and-collect-show-me-your-dataset), [a showcase in Paris, France by Kadist at Centre Pompidou](https://kadist.org/program/the-future-is-not-what-it-used-to-be/), amonst others.


## *Digital Family Card* 
*for UN DP Kazakhstan*

**Role: Senior VR & technical consultant**

## *Central Launcher Software* 
*for the Museum of Future Experiences (MoFE)*

**Role: Developer**

Developed a pair of network control and client softwares to manage the showcase pipeline of the venue for a seamless and synchronized experience to the audience.

The launcher software connects via UDP protocol to each of the 16 PCs for each seat, as well as the audio Mac device, and send specific messages to play (or stop) a selected piece. The client software receives the message and triggers the appropriate actions, and is configurable with a text-based ini file for ease of use and replicability. 

This dual software was robust enough to work without issues over several shows per week. Finally, I provided upgrades and extra functions depending on the new needs of the upcoming shows, including modifications to Unreal Engine projects that required a more intricate connection.
