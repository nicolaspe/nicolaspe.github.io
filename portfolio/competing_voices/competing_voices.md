Competing voices presents an array of 6 personalities which reinterpret what's being played by the performer in their own way. The constant overlapping of voices and sudden cacophonies derived from the same patterns aim to represent a state of constant internal struggle for power, and how we strive to find a balance between them.

The input of the guitar (the performer's conscious voice) is fed to the computer through an interface. Then, it's run through a frequency analysis and given to each voice to interpret using diverse processes such as Markov chains, filters and evolutive patterns. The musical performance is accompanied by a visual presentation that combines geometrical patterns with an altered live feed of my actions.
