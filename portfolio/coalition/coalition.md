Coalition is an exploration of motion as expression of individuality and the struggle against oppressive societies. It is an immersive live experience that represent the union of motion and sound conveying individuality and uniqueness against the status quo of society

We see motion as a form of expression, which conveys individuality and emotions. When placed in the context of its environment, this uniqueness and diversity will often be met with resistance, as society as a whole prefers to maintain the status-quo.

This oppression has long lasting direct and side effects on communities, and is ever present in our times. As individuals, we are powerless against society. As we unite, we aim for the common good.

Coalition aims to instigate a reflection on this issue by letting users explore a 3d environment via motion triggered by their own expression. In this piece, diversity will be represented by choreographies and sounds from different cultures, referencing the oppression of immigrant communities around the world.
